# Getting started with animations
Welcome to PixiEditor. This guide introduces key animation concepts and walks you through the two main ways you can animate your projects:   
- Frame-by-Frame
- Procedural animation.

---

## Understanding the timeline

The timeline is the most important component of animation in PixiEditor. It controls every aspect of your animation flow, including frames, layers, and playback speed.

You can open the timeline in either of these ways:
- Click the **Timeline** icon <span className="pixi-icon icon-timeline"/> on the toolbar at the top of the screen.  
- Go to **View**, choose **Open Tab** and then choose **Timeline**.

### Timeline interface overview
The following image shows the interface of the timeline.
  ![The timeline interface](./img/annotated-timeline.png "The timeline interface")


1. **Frames per second (FPS)**  
    Controls how fast your animation plays. Higher values produce smoother result but require more frames.
    - 60 FPS- Smooth animation (common in games)  
    - 24 FPS - Industry standard for films 


2. <span className="pixi-icon icon-settings"/> **Settings** - opens a menu with timeline related-settings.

3. **Action buttons**

    - <span className="pixi-icon icon-plus-square"/> **Plus icon** - Adds an empty cel to the selected layer
    - <span className="pixi-icon icon-duplicate"/> **Duplicate icon** - Duplicates the current cel
    - <span className="pixi-icon icon-onion"/> **Onion icon** - Toggles onion skinning on/off
    - <span className="pixi-icon icon-trash"/> **Trash icon** - Deletes selected cels

4. **Layers panel**

    From left to right:

    - <span className="pixi-icon eye-icon"/> **Eye icon** - Show/hide the layer
    - **Image thumbnail** - Displays the layer's base image
    - **Layer name** - Name of the layer (e.g., *Slime*) 
    - <span className="pixi-icon icon-chevron-down"/> **Collapse button** - Minimize the layer to save space

5. **Playback controls**

- <span className="pixi-icon icon-step-start"/> Step start - Moves the frame cursor back to the edge of the closest cel.
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-step-back"/> Step Back - Moves the frame cursor back one frame.
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-play" style={{color: "#6fac6f"}}/> Play- Plays the animation
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-step-forward"/> Step Forward - Moves the frame cursor forward one frame.
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-step-end"/> Step End - Moves the frame cursor forward to the edge of the closest cel.
- **00:00.08 / 00:01.75** – Current time and total time in `mm:ss.ff` format. `mm` for minutes, `ss` for seconds, `ff` for hundredths of a second  

6. **Frame bar** 
    This is the top slider that lets you:
   - Drag to change the active frame  
   - Zoom in/out by scrolling over it
   - View frame numbers and ticks

7. **Cel row**
    Displays all cels in a layer. Each cel shows a thumbnail preview and duration.  
   - Drag the edges to change the cel’s length  
   - Drag the cel itself to move it along the timeline

## Animating projects
PixiEditor supports two main animation methods:

### 1. Frame-by-Frame animation

The traditional method of animation. You draw each frame manually to create smooth transitions.

> To learn more, check [Frame-by-Frame Animations](/docs/usage/animating/frame-by-frame/). 


### 2. Procedural animations
This method uses operations and parameters to create movement without manually drawing frames. Think of it as giving a set of instructions. For example: *Move to the right by 10 pixels over 1 second.*  
With this method, you can animate almost any property within the Node graph.  

> To learn more, check: 
> - [Procedural animation](/docs/usage/animating/procedural/).  
> - [Node graph](/docs/usage/node-graph/getting-started-with-node-graph)



:::tip  
You can combine both methods for more dynamic results. For example, use frame-by-frame for character movement and procedural animation for background effects.
