# Getting started with animations
Welcome to PixiEditor. This guide introduces key animation concepts and walks you through the two main ways you can animate your projects:   
- Frame-by-Frame
- Procedural animation.

## Understanding the timeline

The timeline is the most important component of animation in PixiEditor. It controls every aspect of your animation flow, including frames, layers, and playback speed.

You can open the timeline in either of these ways:
- Click the **Timeline** icon <span className="pixi-icon icon-timeline"/> on the toolbar at the top of the screen.  
- Go to **View**, choose **Open Tab** and then choose **Timeline**.

### Timeline interface overview
The following image shows the interface of the timeline.

1. **Frames per second setting** - how fast timeline should play the animation. Higher values require more frames for the same amount of time, but produces smoother result.

    The usual values are:
    - 60 - for smooth animation, usually used in games
    - 24 - movie industry standard

2. <span className="pixi-icon icon-settings"/> **Settings** - opens a menu with timeline related-settings
3. **Action buttons**

- <span className="pixi-icon icon-plus-square"/> - Add an empty cel to the currently selected layer
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-duplicate"/> - Creates a duplicated cel to the currently selected layer. Duplicates the content under active frame.
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-onion"/> - Toggles on/off onion skinning
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-trash"/> - Deletes all selected cels

4. **Layer**

    From the left to the right:

- <span className="pixi-icon icon-eye"/> - Disable whole animation for layer.
- Image Preview - It displays the layer's **base** image.
- Layer Name
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-chevron-down"/> Collapse button, it squishes whole layer animation row, so it takes minimal space.

5. **Playback buttons**

- <span className="pixi-icon icon-step-start"/> - Moves the frame cursor back to the edge of the closest cel.
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-step-back"/> - Moves the frame cursor back one frame.
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-play" style={{color: "#6fac6f"}}/> - Plays the animation
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-step-forward"/> - Moves the frame cursor forward one frame.
- <span className="pixi-icon icon-step-end"/> - Moves the frame cursor forward to the edge of the closest cel.
- `00:00.08/00:01.75` - `current time` / `end time` in `mm:ss.ff` format where `mm` - minutes, `ss` - seconds, `ff` - hundredths of a second

6. **Frame Bar** 

    The frame bar is the top part of the timeline viewport. It displays frame cursor, frame ticks and frame numbers. It is essentially a slider. You can click and drag to change active frame. You can zoom in our out by scrolling over it.

7. **Cel Row**

    Cel row displays all cels within the layer. One cel consists of a preview image and cel length rectangle (how many frames a cel should occupy) that can be shortened or lengthened by dragging the edges. You can also drag the whole cel to move it around.

## Frame by Frame Animations

Frame by frame animation is a traditional method of animating. It involves drawing each frame by hand.

For more information, check out a [dedicated guide](/docs/usage/animating/frame-by-frame)

## Procedural Animations

PixiEditor gives full freedom over animations, meaning you can animate almost any property within the [Node Graph](/docs/usage/node-graph/getting-started-with-node-graph). 
It does not involve any manual drawing, unlike frame by frame animations, but is rather a result of combining operations and parameters.

Think of it as a set of instructions.

`Move to the right by 10 pixels over 1 second`
