Property sockets are part of a Node Graph system. If you are not familiar with the Node Graph, we recommend you to read the [Getting Started with Nodes](/docs/usage/node-graph/getting-started-with-node-graph) guide first.

## What are Property Sockets?

Each Node consists of 2 things: inputs and outputs.

Inputs are on the left side of the Node, and outputs are on the right side. Each input and output has a type, which defines what kind of data it can accept or produce.

### Inputs

Inputs can be in 2 states. **Connected** or **disconnected**. Disconnected inputs usually expose a value editor to the user, allowing them to change the value of the input.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Connected">
  Connected `Size` input does not expose anything. It's value is determined by the output of the node it is connected to. You can preview the value of the input by hovering over the socket.
    <Image src={connectedImage} alt="Connected input" width="200"/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Disconnected">
    Disconnected `Size` input exposes two number inputs.
    <Image src={disconnectedImage} alt="Disconnected input" width="200"/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Outputs

Outputs are always in a connected state. They produce data that can be used by other nodes. Outputs can be connected to inputs of other nodes, allowing you to create complex graphs.

## Property Types

Each property holds/can process a specific type of data. Each data type is represented by a specific color:

### <span style={{color: "#ff8c00"}}>⬤</span> Painter 

A painting operation, each Node that accepts a Painter either connects to the chain of painting operations or paints the chain of operations to the texture.

The simplest example are layers and the **Output Node**. Each layer accepts a <span style={{color: "#ff8c00"}}>⬤</span> `Background` input and returns a `Output` <span style={{color: "#ff8c00"}}>⬤</span>.

While the **Output Node** accepts a <span style={{color: "#ff8c00"}}>⬤</span> `Background` input and does not return anything.

<Image src={painter} alt="Painter Node" />

In that example, chain of 2 painting operations is created.

1. Paint the "New layer 1"
2. Paint the "New layer 2" on top of the first layer with blend mode "Normal" and opacity 100%.

**Output Node** then takes the result of the chain and displays it in the viewport.

### <span style={{color: "#99c47a"}}>⬤</span> Texture

A texture with defined width and height. For example [Create Image Node](/docs/usage/node-graph/nodes/create-image) produces a <span style={{color: "#99c47a"}}>⬤</span> `Texture` output, which can be used by other nodes that accept textures, such as the [Modify Image Node](/docs/usage/node-graph/nodes/modify-image).

### <span style={{color: "#cc5c5c"}}>⬤</span> Filter

Filter object that can be applied via the [Apply Filter Node](/docs/usage/node-graph/nodes/filter/apply-filter) or directly to the layer. Filters can be used to modify the appearance of the texture, such as applying a blur or a color adjustment.

### <span style={{color: "#68abdf"}}>⬤</span> Boolean

A boolean value, which can be either `true` or `false`. Value `0` is equal `false`, and any other value evaluates to `true`.

### <span style={{color: "#ffc66d"}}>⬤</span> Float

A floating point number, which can be used to represent decimal values. It occupies 4 bytes of memory and can represent values from approximately	±1,5 x 10<sup>−45</sup> to ±3,4 x 10<sup>38</sup>

### <span style={{color: "#eea55c"}}>⬤</span> Double

A double-precision floating point number, which can be used to represent decimal values with higher precision than a float. It occupies 8 bytes of memory and can represent values from approximately	±5,0 x 10<sup>−324</sup> to ±1,7 x 10<sup>308</sup>

### <span style={{color: "#8cf2dd"}}>⬤</span> Color

A 32-bit ARGB unpremultiplied color value.

### <span style={{color: "#48b099"}}>⬤</span> Paintable

Paintable is a type that describes fill/brush. Color is a paintable, it describes a solid color fill. Another type of paintable is a Gradient, which describes a gradient fill.

### <span style={{color: "#c984ca"}}>⬤</span> VecD

 (Vector 2 of double precision numbers)

A vector with 2 double precision numbers.

### <span style={{color: "#597513"}}>⬤</span> Vec3D

A vector with 3 double precision numbers.

### <span style={{color: "#c9b4ca"}}>⬤</span> VecI

A vector with 2 integers.

### <span style={{color: "#4c64b1"}}>⬤</span> Integer

An integer value, which can be used to represent whole numbers. It occupies 4 bytes of memory and can represent a number from range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

### <span style={{color: "#C9E4C6"}}>⬤</span> String

A string value, which can be used to represent text.

### <span style={{color: "#a473a5"}}>⬤</span> Ellipse Data
 (Vector Shape)

An ellipse data type, which can be used to represent an ellipse shape.
Properties of the ellipse data type are:
- `Center` (VecD)
- `Radius` (VecD)

### <span style={{color: "#e1d0e1"}}>⬤</span> Points Data

(Vector Shape)

A list of points (VecD).

### <span style={{color: "#f2f2f2"}}>⬤</span> Text Data

(Vector Shape)

A text shape data type, which can be used to represent a text shape.

### <div style={{display: 'inline-block',width: '24px',height: '24px',borderRadius: '50%',background: `conic-gradient( #a473a5 0% 33%, #f2f2f2 33% 66%, #e1d0e1 66% 100% )`,border: '1px solid #ccc', verticalAlign: 'middle'}} /> Vector Shape

A vector shape data type. It can accept any other vector shape data type, such as Ellipse Data, Points Data or Text Data.

### <span style={{color: "#ffea4f"}}>⬤</span> Matrix3x3

A 3x3 matrix, which can be used to represent transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling and perspective.

Each matrix has 9 values, which are represented as a 3x3 grid:

```
| Scale X | Skew X | Offset X |
| Skew Y | Scale Y | Offset Y |
| Persp 0 | Persp 1 | Persp 2 |
```

each component of the matrix is a single precision number (`float`).

### <span style={{color: "#ff00ff"}}>⬤</span> Default

A magenta color is used when the property doesn't have a unique color attached. It usually means that property type is not meant to be connected. Such as dropdown (enum) values.

## Diamond Sockets

Some nodes have diamond-shaped sockets. Which look like this:

<Image src={diamond} width="80" alt="Diamond socket"/>

They accept the same data types as regular, circular sockets, but they are used to represent a special type of data flow.

Diamond sockets are contextful, meaning that the data they "hold" is determined by the context of the node they are connected to.

There are 2 types of contexts:

### No Context

A default context (CPU), which is the only context for circular sockets. A property socket with this context represents a single value of the specified type.

### GPU Context

Some Nodes such as [Modify Image Node](/docs/usage/node-graph/nodes/image/begin-modify-image) expose a GPU context. In GPU context, the property socket with diamond shape work **per pixel**. This means that there is no a single value for the property,
but rather a formula that is applied to the pixel that is being processed.

Let's take a look at this example:

<figure>
<Image src={gpuContext} alt="GPU Context Node" />
<figcaption>_click to zoom_</figcaption>
</figure>

In this example, we're modifying the Mona Lisa image with [Modify Image Node](/docs/usage/node-graph/nodes/image/begin-modify-image). This node exposes 2 diamond-shaped sockets:
- `UV`
- `Color`

Notice how [Modify Image Node](/docs/usage/node-graph/nodes/image/begin-modify-image) consists of 2 parts: Begin and End with blue zone between them.

There are also 2 Nodes connected to Modify Image: [Separate Color](/docs/usage/node-graph/nodes/color/separate-color) and [Combine Color](/docs/usage/node-graph/nodes/color/combine-color). Essentially, in this example, we are swapping red with green channel of the image.

A `Color` is not a single value, but **it points to a color of currently processed pixel**. The `UV` is a coordinate of the pixel in the texture, which is being processed. It's essentially a one big loop.

Imagine it processes a very first pixel of the image (top-left corner). The `Color` would be equal to #647360 <span style={{color: "#647360"}}>■</span> and `UV` would be equal to (0, 0). Then Separate Color Node would 
return:

- `R` = 100
- `G` = 115
- `B` = 96
- `A` = 255

:::caution
In reality color values inside GPU Context are normalized to 0-1 range, but it's irrelevant for this example.
:::

Finally, the `Combine Color Node` would take these values and swap them, resulting in:

- `R` = 115
- `G` = 100
- `B` = 96
- `A` = 255

This color value and the `UV` are passed to the `End Modify Image`, which puts the modified pixel back to the texture at the same `UV` coordinate (0, 0).

:::tip
You can modify UV as well to put the pixel to a different location in the texture. For example, you can use UV to flip the image, or to apply a transformation to the image.
:::

Then it processes the next pixel to the right, and so on until it reaches the end of the image.

### Mixing GPU and CPU Contexts

You can connect circular sockets to diamond sockets and vice versa. But you need to be careful about the context:

| Context flow | Behavior                                                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU -> GPU   | ✅ Single value is passed to GPU context, it doesn't change. |
| GPU -> GPU   | ✅ Normal GPU data flow. Value dependend on the context      |
| GPU -> CPU   | 🚫 Not allowed! Context data can never leave GPU context.    |

**Diamond socket can act the same as circular socket, if it is used in CPU context, but circular socket can never become GPU context aware.**

_GPU context is basically a Shader. Modify Image Node generates a shader code out of connected Nodes and their properties_

## Implicit conversions

Some property types can be implicitly converted from one type to another. If the connection is possible, a noodle (line) connecting both sockets will become a gradient line, that starts with the color of the source socket and ends with the color of the destination socket.

### Multi value to single value 

A `VecD` can be implicitly converted to a `Float` (or any single numeric value) by taking the first value of the vector.

(10, 20) -> 10
(10, 20, 30) -> 10

### Single value to multi value

A `Float` (or any single numeric value) can be implicitly converted to a `VecD` by creating a vector with X and Y values equal to the float value.

For VecD to Vec3D conversion, the Z value is set to Y value (X, Y, Y).

```
(10) -> (10, 10) (Double -> VecD)
(10) -> (10, 10, 10) (Double -> Vec3D)
(10, 20) -> (10, 20, 20) (VecD -> Vec3D)
```
