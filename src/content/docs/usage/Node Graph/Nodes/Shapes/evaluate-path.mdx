  name: 'Evaluate Path'
  category: Shape
  icon: icon-train
  isPair: false
  hasPreview: false
  inputs:
  - name: Shape
    type: Vector Shape
    description: 'The vector shape to evaluate.'
    isContextful: false
    default: 'null'
  - name: Offset
    type: Double
    description: 'The "probing" value along the path. If Normalize Offset is true, 0 is the start of the path, and 1 is the end of the path. If Normalize Offset is false, it is a distance along the path.'
    isContextful: false
    default: '0.0'
  - name: Normalize Offset
    type: Boolean
    description: 'If true, the Offset is normalized to the range [0, 1], where 0 is the start of the path and 1 is the end of the path. If false, the Offset is treated as a distance along the path.'
    isContextful: false
    default: 'true'
  outputs:
  - name: Position
    type: VecD
    description: 'An absolute position on canvas of the evaluated point on the path.'
    isContextful: false
    default: (0, 0)
  - name: Tangent
    type: VecD
    description: 'The tangent vector at the evaluated point on the path, indicating the direction of the path at that point.'
    isContextful: false
    default: (0, 0)
  - name: Matrix
    type: Matrix3x3
    description: 'A transformation matrix with position and tangent. You can use this matrix to place an object at the evaluated point on the path.'
    isContextful: false
    default: Identity
  description: 'Evaluates a point on a vector path at a specified offset, returning the position, tangent, and transformation matrix for that point. This is useful for placing objects along paths or extracting information about the path geometry.'
