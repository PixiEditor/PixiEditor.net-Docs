  - name: Min Distance
    type: Double
    description: 'The minimum distance between points. This value determines how close points can be to each other before one of them is removed. If two points are closer than this distance, one will be discarded.'

  - name: Seed
    type: Integer
    description: 'The seed for random selection. This is used to ensure that the process of removing close points is deterministic, allowing for reproducible results. Points are selected randomly during the filtering process, and the seed controls this randomness.'
