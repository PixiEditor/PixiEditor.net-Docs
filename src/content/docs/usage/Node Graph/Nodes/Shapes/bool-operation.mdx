This node is useful for creating intricate designs and manipulating vector data in a non-destructive way.'

### VectorPathOp

The `VectorPathOp` is a enum type that defines the different boolean operations that can be performed on vector shapes. The available operations are:
- **Difference**: Subtracts the second shape from the first.
- **Intersect**: Keeps only the overlapping area of the two shapes.
- **Union**: Combines the two shapes into one.
- **Xor**: Combines the two shapes, excluding the overlapping area.
- **ReverseDifference**: Subtracts the first shape from the second.
