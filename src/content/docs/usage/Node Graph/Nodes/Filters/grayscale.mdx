## Grayscale Mode

The `Grayscale Mode` input allows you to choose how the grayscale effect is calculated. The available modes are:
- **Weighted**: This mode applies a weighted average to the RGB channels, giving more importance to the green channel, which is more sensitive to human vision. (R: 0.299, G: 0.587, B: 0.114, A: 0)
- **Average**: This mode calculates the average of the RGB channels, treating all channels equally. (R: 1/3, G: 1/3, B: 1/3, A: 0)
- **Custom**: This mode allows you to specify custom weights for each channel using the `Weight Factor` input. The values represent the contribution of red, green, and blue channels respectively.
