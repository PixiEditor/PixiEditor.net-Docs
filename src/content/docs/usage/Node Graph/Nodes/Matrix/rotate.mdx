## Rotation Types
The rotation can be specified in different units, each affecting how the angle is interpreted. The available rotation types are:

- **Degrees**: The angle is specified in degrees, a common unit for measuring angles in geometry. One full rotation is 360 degrees.
- **Radians**: The angle is specified in radians, a unit of angular measure used in mathematics and physics. One full rotation is 2Ï€ radians, which is equivalent to 360 degrees.
