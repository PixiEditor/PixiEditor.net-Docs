## Easing Types

The `Easing Type` input allows you to select from various easing functions that define how the value transitions over time. Each easing type has 3 variations (except for `Linear`):

- `In` easing functions start slowly and accelerate towards the end.
- `Out` easing functions start quickly and decelerate towards the end.
- `In Out` easing functions start slowly, accelerate in the middle, and decelerate towards the end.

There are a few common easing types available:
- **Linear**: A constant speed transition.
- **Sine**: A smooth transition that follows a sine wave.
- **Quad**: A quadratic easing function. 
- **Cubic**: A cubic easing function.
- **Quart**: A quartic easing function.
- **Quint**: A quintic easing function.
- **Expo**: An exponential easing function.
- **Circ**: A circular easing function.
- **Back**: An easing function that overshoots the target value.
- **Elastic**: An easing function that oscillates around the target value. Like a rubber band.
- **Bounce**: An easing function that simulates a bouncing effect.
