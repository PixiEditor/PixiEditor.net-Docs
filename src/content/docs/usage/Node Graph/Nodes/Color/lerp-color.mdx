  description: 'Creates a linear interpolation between two colors based on a specified time factor. The "From" color is the starting point, the "To" color is the endpoint, and the "Time" factor determines how far along the interpolation is. A value of 0 for "Time" will return the "From" color, a value of 1 will return the "To" color, and values in between will return a mix of both colors.'
