## Using the Shader Node

Shader node is the most flexible and powerful node in the Node Graph, but it is the most advanced as well.

Check out our [Mini SKSL Guide](/docs/usage/node-graph/mini-sksl-guide) for a quick introduction to the SKSL Shader Language.

## Uniforms

Uniforms are variables that can be passed from Node Graph to the shader. They can be used to control various aspects of the shader's behavior, such as colors or parameters.
By default, any uniform written in a shader code will be automatically detected and added to the node's inputs.

### Built-in Uniforms

There are some uniforms that are automatically handled by PixiEditor and are not exposed.

- **iResolution**: The resolution of current render output. It is usually a document size.
- **iNormalizedTime**: The normalized animation time, ranging from 0 to 1.
- **iFrame**: The current animation frame number.
- **iImage**: Refers to the `Background` input.

## Color Space Type

The **Color Space Type** determines how the shader interprets color values. The available options are:
- **Inherit**: The shader will use the color space of the input image or context.
- **sRGB**: The shader will interpret color values in the sRGB color space.
- **Linear**: The shader will interpret color values in the linear color space.
