## Posterization Modes

Posterization can be applied in different modes, each affecting the image in a unique way. The available modes are:

### RGB

Each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) is posterized independently, resulting in a colorful posterization effect.

### Luminance

The image is converted to grayscale based on luminance, and then posterized. This mode emphasizes brightness levels rather than color.

## Color Spaces

### Inherit

The posterization effect is applied in the color space of the input image. This is useful for maintaining consistency with the original image's color representation.

### sRGB

The posterization effect is applied in the sRGB color space. It's usually the best choice if you are unsure which one to use.

### Linear

The posterization effect is applied in a linear color space. By default PixiEditor processes colors in linear sRGB color space.
