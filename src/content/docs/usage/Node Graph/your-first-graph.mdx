## Creating Your First Node Graph

If you didn't read the [Getting Started with Nodes](/docs/usage/node-graph/getting-started-with-node-graph) guide, we recommend you to do so first. It will help you understand the basics of nodes and how they work.

Without further ado, let's create your first Node Graph!

<Steps>

1. Create a new document in PixiEditor by going to `File -> New`.
2. Open the Node Graph by clicking the <span class="pixi-icon">î¦¤</span> button in the top center of the window or by going to `View -> Open Tab -> Graph View`.
3. You will see a Node Graph with a single layer connected to the Output Node. This is the starting point of your Node Graph.

</Steps>

## Adding Nodes

Now that you have your first Node Graph, let's add some nodes to it.

Right click on the empty space, this will open a context menu with a list of available nodes. You can type the name of the node you want to add in the search bar.
