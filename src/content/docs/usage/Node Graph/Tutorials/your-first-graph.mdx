First of all, congratulations on deciding to learn about Node Graphs in PixiEditor! It's a fascinating and powerful system, you won't regret it.

<Aside type="caution">

Node Graph is a feature only present in PixiEditor 2.0 and later versions.

## Creating Your First Node Graph

If you didn't read the [Getting Started with Nodes](/docs/usage/node-graph/getting-started-with-node-graph) guide, we recommend you to do so first. It will help you understand the basics of nodes and how they work.

Without further ado, let's create your first Node Graph!

<Steps>

1. Create a new document in PixiEditor by going to `File -> New`.
2. Open the Node Graph by clicking the <span class="pixi-icon icon-nodes"/> button in the top center of the window or by going to `View -> Open Tab -> Graph View`.
3. You will see a Node Graph with a single layer connected to the Output Node. This is the starting point of your Node Graph.

</Steps>

## Adding Nodes

Now that you have your first Node Graph, let's add some nodes to it.

<kbd>Right click</kbd> or hit <kbd>Space</kbd> on the empty area, this will open a context menu with a list of available nodes. You can type the name of the node you want to add in the search bar.

<summary>Node Types</summary>

In version 2.0.0.97, there are several types of nodes available:

- **Color** - Nodes such as Separate Color into RGB, HSV, and HSL, which allow you to manipulate colors in various ways.
- **Image** - It's a big category with various nodes, such as Create Image, Mask, Noise, and more, which allow you to work with images.
- **Structure** - "Structure" in PixiEditor refers to the elements in a layer tree. This includes Image Layers, Vector Layers and Folders.
- **Numbers** - Various numerical related nodes, most notably the Math node, which allows you to perform mathematical operations on numbers.
- **Effects** - Standalone effects such as Raster Outline or custom Shader
- **Workspace** - Nodes that allow for workspace cusomization - multiple outputs and export zones.
- **Shape** - Nodes that allow you to create and manipulate shapes
- **Matrix** - Matrix related nodes, such as Transform, which allow you to manipulate the position, rotation, and scale of nodes.
- **Filters** - Nodes that contain various filters - for example, Blur, Shadow, and Color Correction.
- **Animation** - Nodes that allow you to create procedural animations.
- **Misc** - Miscellaneous nodes that don't fit into any other category, such as Document Info.

4. Let's add a <span class="pixi-icon small icon-cone"/> **Shadow Filter** node. You can find it in the **Filters** category. Click on it to add it to the Node Graph.

5. Click on the red-ish circle <span style={{color: "#cc5c5c"}}>â¬¤</span>, next to the "Filter" label, on the right side of the <span class="pixi-icon small icon-cone"/> **Shadow Filter** node, and drag it to the "Filter" socket with the same color in the **<span class="pixi-icon small icon-layers-double"/> Base Layer** node (on the **left** side of the node). 

6. Now go back to your document (make sure Base Layer is selected in the Layers panel) and try drawing something. You should see a shadow effect applied to your drawing!

</Steps>

### Sockets

You may have noticed that the nodes have different colored circles and diamonds on their sides. These are called **sockets**. They are used to connect nodes together and transfer data between them.
To learn more about sockets, check out the [Sockets](/docs/usage/node-graph/property-sockets) guide.
