import masked from 'assets/masked.png';
import  mask  from 'assets/mask.png';
import  maskResult  from 'assets/mask-result.png';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Masking allows you to control which parts of an image are visible and which are not with the use of a mask image.

## How masks work

In PixiEditor, masks define opacity based on lightness. 

In other words, the brighter the pixel in the mask, the more visible the corresponding pixel in the image will be. The darker the pixel in the mask, the more transparent the corresponding pixel in the image will be.

Black pixel = 0% opacity (fully transparent)
White pixel = 100% opacity (fully opaque)

Anything in between will be a percentage of opacity based on the lightness value of the pixel in the mask.

## Example of a mask

For an image like this:
<Image src={masked} alt="Masked Image" width={256} />

We can use a mask like this:

<Image src={mask} alt="Mask Image" width={256} />

And the result will be:

<Image src={maskResult} alt="Masked Result" width={256}/>
