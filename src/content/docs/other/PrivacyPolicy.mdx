On the event of the PixiEditor application crash, PixiEditor generates .zip archives containing the crash report (specified in section 1), opened files (images) and related logs.

## 4.1 Potential for Accidental Personal Data Inclusion

While we strive to ensure that all crash reports and anonymous analytics are fully anonymized and do not contain any personal data, it is possible that, despite our best efforts, some information may unintentionally be included that could lead to indirect identification (e.g., system usernames or identifiable text in error messages).

To mitigate this risk, we take the following steps:

    - File paths are removed and replaced with a placeholder from crash reports before sending them to us.
    - No identifiers (such as email addresses or IP addresses) are included in analytics or crash logs.
    - All analytics data is processed without user identifiers and cannot be traced back to an individual. Each analytics session is tied to a unique session ID that is not linked to any personal information.

We treat any data that may potentially be personal under the GDPR with the same care and apply appropriate safeguards.

If you believe that a crash report or analytics entry may have included personal data, you have the right to request access, rectification, or deletion of that data. Please contact us at info@pixieditor.net with details.

## 4.2 Data Retention

We retain anonymous usage analytics for a period of 2 years. After this period, the data is automatically deleted from our servers.

## 5. Accounts

PixiEditor is available on Steam. Using PixiEditor through Steam will display your publicly available Steam username and avatar in the application. This information is used to personalize your experience, PixiEditor does not send
this information outside your computer and we do not have access to it.
