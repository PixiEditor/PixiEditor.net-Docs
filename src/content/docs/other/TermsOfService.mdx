Terms of Service

Effective Date: 09.06.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)

Company: Pixi Labs sp z o.o, Międzyświeć, ul. Bładnicka 23, 43-430

## 1. Introduction

These Terms govern your use of the PixiEditor desktop application (“App”) and any related products or services offered by Pixi Labs sp z o.o (“we,” “us,” or “our”), including but not limited to commercial extensions (“Extensions”) and account-based features.

These Terms do not limit or override your rights under the LGPLv3 license, which continues to apply to the open-source components of the App.

“App” refers to the open-source PixiEditor software licensed under LGPLv3.
“Extension” refers to any separately licensed, closed-source content or feature sold or distributed by Pixi Labs sp z o.o for use within the App.

## 2. License and Open-Source Components

The App is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPLv3). You may use, modify, and distribute the App in accordance with that license. However, certain Extensions may be offered under separate commercial terms as described below.

## 3. User Accounts and Extension Access

    To purchase and activate Extensions, you must provide a valid email address. An account will be created for you for purchase verification and license management.

    Your account data is only used to validate purchases and is not required for offline use of the base App.

    For information on how we handle your data, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy).

    Your data is processed based on our legitimate interest in license management and fraud prevention. You may request access to or deletion of your personal data at any time by contacting us at info@pixieditor.net.

## 4. Extension License Terms

This section applies to paid Extensions offered separately from the LGPLv3-licensed App. Each Extension is governed by its own sub-section, as outlined below.

### 4.1 Founder’s Pack (also known as “Founder’s Edition” or “Founder’s Bundle”)

The following terms apply to the commercial extension referred to as the Founder’s Pack, which may also be marketed or described as “Founder’s Edition” or “Founder’s Bundle.” These names refer to the same product and license.

Included in Purchase:

    - A perpetual license to use the contents of the Extension, which currently includes:

        * 23 curated color palettes
        * 4 pre-made workspace files (App documents in .pixi format that include a pre-configured Node Graph setup. These workspaces serve as ready-made starting environments for specific types of projects. A workspace may also include additional functionality used to configure the environment, such as — but not limited to — custom dialogs or predefined layout element placements at startup.)

    - Additional palettes or workspaces may be added in future updates

    - All updates to this Extension are included at no additional cost

    - Refund eligibility under Section 5

License Grant:
You are granted a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use this Extension within the App. This license does not grant you ownership of the Extension or any of its components.

Restrictions:
You may not:

    - Distribute, resell, or sublicense the Extension or its contents

    - Use the Extension with any software other than the App

    - Modify or reverse-engineer the Extension files unless explicitly permitted

Additional Extensions will be added to this section as they become available.

## 5. Refund Policy

By purchasing and downloading a paid Extension, you agree that the digital content will be available to you immediately, and you acknowledge that your 14-day right of withdrawal is waived once the Extension is downloaded or activated.

To request a refund, contact: info@pixieditor.net

## 6. Connectivity and Validation

Although the App runs offline, the App periodically connects to our servers to validate your Extensions license. You must maintain occasional internet access to retain access to paid Extensions.

If validation cannot be performed for an extended period, access to paid Extensions may be temporarily suspended until a successful validation occurs.

## 7. Updates and Support

We may release updates to the App and Extensions. Updates to purchased Extensions are provided free of charge. Support is offered via email and community forums, as available.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of the App or Extensions.

The App and Extensions are provided “as is” without warranties of any kind.

## 9. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and interpreted according to the laws of Poland. Any disputes shall be resolved by the competent courts in Poland.

We encourage you to contact us first to resolve any concerns informally. If no resolution is reached, legal proceedings shall take place under Polish jurisdiction.
