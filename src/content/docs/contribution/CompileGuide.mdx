<Steps>

1. Clone Repository with nested submodules

    `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor.git`

    or if cloned already, init submodules with

    ```
    cd PixiEditor
    ```
    ```
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2. Download [Wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases) release for your system
3. Extract downloaded sdk 
4. Set `WASI_SDK_PATH` enviroment variable to extracted directory
5. Run 

    <Aside type="tip">
        You can skip this step if you only want to run PixiEditor.Desktop project
    </Aside>

    ```
    dotnet workload install wasi-experimental
    ```

6. Open PixiEditor/src/PixiEditor.sln in Visual Studio or other IDE of your choice

7. Build solution and run PixiEditor.Desktop project

    This is how the repo structure looks like after cloning:

    <FileTree>
    - PixiEditor
      - src
        - PixiEditor.sln < -- Source code solution file
        - PixiEditor.Desktop.csproj < -- run it to start PixiEditor
        - PixiEditor.csproj < -- Main project, contains most of the code
      - tests
        - PixiEditorTests.sln
      - samples
        - PixiEditorExtensionSamples.sln < -- Solution containing sample extensions for PixiEditor
        - Sample1_HelloWorld.csproj
        - Sample2_LocalizationSample.csproj
    </FileTree>

    Either open `PixiEditor/src/PixiEditor.sln` in your IDE of choice or run the following command in terminal:
    
    <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```
    dotnet run src/PixiEditor.Desktop/ -r win-x64
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```
    dotnet run src/PixiEditor.Desktop/ -r linux-x64
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="macOS">
    ```
    dotnet run src/PixiEditor.Desktop/ -r osx-arm64
    ```
    Replace `osx-arm64` with `osx-x64` if you are on Intel Mac.
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">

If you build whole solution, you may encounter an error saying workload `wasm-tools` is not installed. You can ignore that error, since it only applies to PixiEditor.Browser project, which is not currently supported. 

</Aside>

### Known issues and solutions

#### Class `X_Action` not found

It means that code generators did not run correctly. This happens on .NET versions below 8.0.405. Ensure that you have .NET SDK 8.0.**405** or higher installed.

Do not run PixiEditor with .NET 9, `wasi-experimental` workload is not compatible with .NET 9.

#### `wasm-tools` workload is not installed

This error can be ignored, since it only applies to PixiEditor.Browser project, which is not currently supported.
